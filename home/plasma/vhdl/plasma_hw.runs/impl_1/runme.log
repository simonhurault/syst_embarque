Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (REQP-1840) RAMB18 async control check - The RAMB18E1 inst_2/u2_ram/RAMB16_S9_inst0 has an input control pin inst_2/u2_ram/RAMB16_S9_inst0/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: inst_2/u2_ram/pc_reg_reg[12][10]) which is driven by a register (inst_2/u1_cpu/u2_mem_ctrl/opcode_reg_reg[14]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
